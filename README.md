## Parses the main, debug, and startup logs of Icinga.

When you run this module, it performs a few tasks under the hood:

- Sets the default paths to the log files (but donâ€™t worry, you can override the defaults)
- Makes sure each multiline log event gets sent as a single event
- Uses ingest node to parse and process the log lines, shaping the data into a structure suitable for visualizing in Kibana
- Deploys dashboards for visualizing the log data

### Compatibility

The icinga module was tested with Icinga >= 2.x on various Linux and Windows systems.

This module is not available for macOS.
